Hiyo. My name is Vickie. 

Iâ€™m a security researcher focusing on web security. Welcome to my blog!

In this blog, I will explore different topics within cybersecurity. 
In particular, expect many posts about web security, web hacking, and penetration testing.

If you have any comments, tips, or questions, hit me up on Twitter!
